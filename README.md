# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster ðŸš¢

This repository contains my solution to the **Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** competition.

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck using various features such as age, sex, class, etc.

## File Structure

- `titanic_solution.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- (Optional) `titanic_solution.html`: A static HTML version of the notebook (read-only).

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Submission file generation

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
